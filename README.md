# DDoS DNS Attack Analysis ‚Äì Incident Response Worksheet

This is a portfolio project, a part of my cybersecurity learning journey. It covers the detailed analysis of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targeted a DNS server. The worksheet follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions:

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover
---

## üîç What I Did

- Studied how DDoS attacks work, especially when targeting DNS servers
- Simulated the process of analyzing an incident using a structured template
- Documented each stage of the NIST framework in simple, beginner-friendly language
- Focused on improving incident response thinking and post-attack planning

---

## üß† Key Concepts Covered

- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
- DNS server functionality
- Firewall rules and baseline configuration
- Traffic monitoring and log analysis
- Incident response lifecycle
- Recovery planning and backup strategies

---

## ‚úÖ How to Use This

If you're learning cybersecurity, use this project to:

- Practice analyzing security events using a real-world format
- Learn how to apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Understand how to structure a basic incident response document
- Use it as a reference for future hands-on projects or certification prep

If you're viewing this on GitHub:

1. Open The "DDoS Attack Analysis Report" document.
2. Read through each section (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
3. Think about how each part would apply in a real organization
4. Adapt the format for your own reports or portfolio
5. I even provided the template.

## üìö Learning Reflection

Working on this project helped me:

- Understand how attackers exploit DNS infrastructure
- Think like a security analyst when reviewing logs and response actions
- Build confidence in documenting security incidents in a professional format

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques Mentioned

- Firewall configuration review
- Intrusion detection systems (like Snort or Suricata)
- Log analysis and network traffic monitoring
- DNS backup and disaster recovery planning

---

## üìå Next Steps

- Apply the same format to other types of attacks (like phishing or ransomware)
- Try real-time analysis using PCAP files in Wireshark
- Build an incident response playbook with reusable templates
